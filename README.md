# Multiclass Classification Algorithm

## Project Overview
This project implements and compares two multiclass classification algorithms: one-vs-all and all-pairs. Both approaches were implemented using our own implementation of binary logistic regression. Both our one-vs-all and all-pairs algorithms were evaluated against scikit-learn's implementations using a Kaggle obesity dataset.

## Objectives
- Implement the one-vs-all and all-pairs algorithms for multiclass classification.
- Implement the binary logistic regression model for the binary classification algorithm.
- Apply these algorithms to an obesity risk dataset to classify risk categories.
- Compare and contrast the performance of the algorithms.
- Provide detailed explanations of the methodology, including representation, loss, and optimization strategies


## Setting Up the Environment

This project requires specific dependencies to ensure compatibility and reproducibility. These dependencies are listed in the `environment.yaml` file. Follow the steps below to set up the environment:

### Steps to Set Up

1. **Locate the `environment.yaml` file**  
   The YAML file specifies the environment name and the required dependencies for this project.

2. **Create the environment using Conda**  
   Run the following command to create the environment:

   ```bash
   conda env create -f environment.yaml
### 3. Activate the Environment

Once the environment is created, activate it using the following command:

bash
conda activate multiclass-classification

### 4. Activate the Environment

Once the environment is created, activate it using the following command:
conda activate multiclass-classification

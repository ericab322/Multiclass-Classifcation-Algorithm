# Multiclass Classification Algorithm

##Project Overview
This project implements and compares two multiclass classification algorithms: one-vs-all and all-pairs. Both approaches were implemented using a binary classification model previously developed in coursework. The algorithms were evaluated to analyze their performance, advantages, and limitations.

##Objectives
- Implement the one-vs-all and all-pairs algorithms for multiclass classification.
- Use a binary classification model from prior homework assignments.
- Compare and contrast the performance of the algorithms.
- Provide detailed explanations of the methodology, including representation, loss, and optimization strategies
